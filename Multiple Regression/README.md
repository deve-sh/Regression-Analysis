# <div align='center'> Multiple Regression Analysis</div>

A Regression concerning just one independent variable is not enough. Sometimes, there are more than one variable that a variable depends upon.

To get familiar with regression, read the README.md concerning Linear Regression first.

## Algorithm

<ol>
	<li>First Obtain all the possible values for X3 (Dependent Variable), X1 and X2 (Independent Variables).</li>
	<li>Using The <b>Method Of Least Squares</b>, obtain an equation of plane of regression on 3 Variables.</li>
	<li>Using <b>Yule's Notation</b>, substitute the values of co-efficients of X1 and X2 with <b>Partial Regression Coefficients</b> b31.2 and b32.1 respectively.</li>
	<li>Using the obtained Plane Of Regression, estimate the value of X3 and provided X1 and X2.</li>
</ol>

## Use

Open the <b>main.py</b> file using any IDE, and go using it just like any ordinary Python File.
