# <div align='center'>Estimation Using Regression Analysis</div>
<br>
<b>Correlation</b> is the measure of linear relation between two interrelated variables.

<b>Regression</b> is a way to estimate the outcome of an arbitrary variable input based on data observed or extracted from previous observations based on Correlation.

This program tends to automate the simplest of tasks of Regression Analysis.

### What this measures.

Suppose, a doctor has a record of the cholesterol of a set of persons depending on the fat intake. Now suppose if a person with cholesterol <b>X</b> walks in, and he does not know what his/her fat intake <b>Y</b> is. The doctor needs a way to find out the fat intake before he/she can prescribe the right dosage of medication to provide to the patient. In situations such as this, estimation using Linear Regression is extremely helpful.

This method is useful when one wants to predict what the output will be on the basis of the given data with the highest amount of precision.

### Algorithm

The method of estimation uses Covariance between the two variables, Coefficient Of Regression and Regression Lines.

<ol>
    <li>Accept the value of Inputs, followed by the values of Outputs pertaining to each of the Inputs. And the value at which to estimate.</li>
    <li>Find the <b>Covariance</b> between the data. (I.e : The Joint Variation between the two variables.)</li>
    <li>Find the <b>Coefficient of Regression</b> using the dataset and formulate the <b>Equation of Line of Regression.</b></li>
    <li>Using the line of regression so obtained, formulate the final estimated value.</li>
</ol>

### Use

To use the Regression Library. Just open the <b>Linear Regression.py</b> file using any IDE.
